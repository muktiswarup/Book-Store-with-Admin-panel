const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const role = useSelector((state) => state.auth.role);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (
      localStorage.getItem("id") &&
      localStorage.getItem("token") &&
      localStorage.getItem("role")
    ) {
      dispatch(authActions.login());
      dispatch(authActions.changeRole(localStorage.getItem("role")));
    }
  }, []);
The code snippet you're asking about is used to persist user authentication state by checking if there are relevant items in localStorage and then dispatching actions to update the Redux store.

Here’s an explanation of what’s happening, and why this if block is necessary:

What the if block does:
Checks if user data exists in localStorage:
localStorage.getItem("id"), localStorage.getItem("token"), and localStorage.getItem("role") check whether the user’s id, authentication token, and role are stored in the browser’s localStorage.
Restores the user's authentication state:
If all three pieces of data (id, token, and role) exist in localStorage, the user is considered to be "authenticated."
The authActions.login() is dispatched to update the Redux state to reflect that the user is logged in.
authActions.changeRole(localStorage.getItem("role")) updates the user's role (e.g., "admin", "user") in the Redux state.
Why you need this check (if block):
Persistent login state:

Without this check, whenever the user refreshes the page, closes the browser, or revisits the site, their login state would be lost. The app wouldn't "remember" that they were logged in. This if block ensures that even after refreshing the page, the app fetches the login data from localStorage and keeps the user logged in without forcing them to log in again.
Security validation:

Checking for the presence of a token, id, and role ensures that the user is validly authenticated and that the necessary information exists to properly restore their session. Without this check, the app might assume the user is logged in even if no valid token or session information is present, potentially leading to security issues.
Consistent app state:

By restoring the user's role, you ensure that the app knows what permissions the user has (e.g., access to admin routes, etc.). Without this, users might be treated as unauthenticated or might not have the correct permissions.
What happens if you don't include this check?
User would be logged out after a page refresh:

Without the if block, the app won’t check localStorage after a refresh, so even if the user had logged in earlier, they would appear logged out after a refresh or when they revisit the page.
Loss of session continuity:

The user will have to log in every time they refresh the page, close and reopen the browser, or navigate to different pages. This would negatively impact the user experience.
Incorrect state:

If the role or token is missing, the app might behave inconsistently. For instance, a user who should have admin rights might be treated as a normal user, or vice versa, depending on how the rest of the app is structured.
Summary:
The if block checks if the user is already authenticated by looking into localStorage. Without this check, you risk:

Losing the logged-in state after page refresh.
Forcing the user to log in again after every browser session.
Handling roles and permissions incorrectly.
In a real project, not having this persistence would create significant usability issues and a poor user experience.
